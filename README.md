# Texel Moda - Virtual Try-On E-commerce Platform

Texel Moda is a fashion e-commerce website featuring virtual try-on capabilities built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion.

## Features

- Modern responsive UI design
- Product browsing and filtering
- Virtual try-on functionality powered by Texel.Moda's Try-On Diffusion API
- Shopping cart functionality
- Smooth animations and transitions using Framer Motion

## Virtual Try-On Integration

The platform integrates with the **Virtual Try-On Diffusion [VTON-D]** technology by Texel.Moda through their RapidAPI service:

- Users can upload their photos and try on different clothing items
- Advanced options include text prompts for avatar, clothing, and background
- Background replacement options
- Image generation with seed control for consistent results

### How It Works

1. Users upload their avatar photo or use a text prompt to generate an avatar
2. Users select clothing items or provide text descriptions
3. Optional background customization
4. The API generates a realistic composite image showing the clothing on the user
